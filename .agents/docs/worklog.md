# machud worklog

Async review trail. One dated bullet per milestone: what changed, verify status,
anything to eyeball. Newest first.

## 2026-06-20

- **RD4 (part 8) — GPU history graph (branch `redesign`).** Upgraded the GPU panel's 1-row Sparkline
  to the braille `Graph` (height 3 — tier-2, shorter than the hero graphs), completing the "every util
  panel shows real history" density theme (CPU/MEM/GPU). Visual change — guarded by no-overflow@120 +
  panel-render; `pnpm verify` PASS (67). **Next:** tier-3 (Disk/Sensors) compaction, remaining
  stability (fixed-height lists, right-aligned numerics), hue confinement, then RD5 (responsive).

- **RD4 (part 7) — stability: battery power row always present (branch `redesign`).** Principle-8 fix
  for the owner's "rows jump / grow taller": the BATTERY `power` row was `v-if="watts"`, so it vanished
  with no charge flow (charged on AC, no adapter watts), shrinking the panel a row each time charging
  finishes / you unplug. Now it ALWAYS renders — `±NW · NW adapter` when there's flow, else `on AC`
  (battery present) / `—` (none). TDD: inject a no-flow battery → the power row must still render; red
  (vanished) → green. `MIN_CHECKS` 66→67. `pnpm verify` PASS (67). **Next stability:** pad the
  top-process/app lists to a fixed 3 rows; right-align numeric columns (health/cycles).

- **RD4 (part 6) — 3-tier layout (branch `redesign`).** Reordered App.vue into the DESIGN hierarchy:
  tier-1 CPU+MEM (heroes), **tier-2 Network (lead) + GPU + Battery**, **tier-3 Disk + Sensors**.
  Previously tier-2 was GPU+Disk+Net and tier-3 was Battery+Sensors — now Network leads (owner-ranked
  above Battery), Battery is medium, Disk/Sensors compress to the bottom. Pure reorder (same panel-count
  per row) → no overflow; verify's no-overflow@120 + all-panels-render guard it (visual change,
  eyeballed). `pnpm verify` PASS (66). **Next:** compact tier-3 Disk/Sensors into a true one-line status
  strip; GPU history graph; then stability (fixed rows / right-aligned numeric columns).

- **RD4 (part 5) — MEM hero density: BigNumber + braille graph (branch `redesign`).** After pt4 the
  density flipped (CPU fuller than MEMORY → MEM had the empty bottom). Brought MEMORY to tier-1 parity:
  replaced the small `61%` with a **BigNumber** and the 1-row Sparkline with the tall **braille Graph**
  (the same components as CPU — Principle 6 consistency), keeping the used bar, wired/swap, and top
  apps. TDD: inject `memory.usedPct=88` + `cpu.usage=11` so only a MEM BigNumber emits the `█ █ █ █`
  88-signature; red→green. `MIN_CHECKS` 65→66. `pnpm verify` PASS (66). Tier-1 now balanced — both
  heroes lead with big number + history graph + bars + a 3-item list.
  **Eyeball / next:** graphs are data-honest (MEM fills ~59%, CPU sparse at idle — both flow live).
  Still on the RD4 list: MEM wired/compressed/app breakdown bar, GPU/DISK history, then the 3-tier
  layout + stability (fixed rows / right-aligned numeric columns).

- **RD4 (part 4) — CPU top-process list (density; branch `redesign`).** Owner feedback on the live
  frame: the CPU hero is "a big panel with little content" (Principle 8). Root cause: CPU had *less*
  content than MEMORY, so it stretched to MEMORY's height with an empty bottom. Fix — a **top-CPU-
  process list** (`cpu.topProcs` via `ps -A -o pcpu=,comm= -r`, mirroring memory.ts's top-by-RSS),
  rendered as 3 right-aligned `name … N%` rows. CpuPanel now carries BigNumber + history graph + P/E
  avg bars + per-core load grid + top processes — real, always-present, comparative data. TDD:
  `cpu.topProcs` array check + inject a distinctive name → renders; red→green. `MIN_CHECKS` 63→65.
  `pnpm verify` PASS (65). **Density now FLIPPED** — CPU is fuller than MEMORY, so MEM needs its
  matching hero/breakdown/history pass next. The CPU graph reads sparse at idle (honest area chart at
  low load; flows live). Also stamped **D15** (mac|hud wordmark VOUCHED) and removed `cool-proto.mjs`.

- **RD4 (part 3) — per-core grid coloured by load (branch `redesign`).** New `CoreGrid.vue`: one
  mini-bar per core (block glyph, height ∝ load), **coloured by `levelColor` (load), not by cluster** —
  E and P render as separate labelled groups; a single cluster (Intel) → one unlabelled row, never
  `0P+0E` (DESIGN). Replaced the old single cluster-coloured cores row in CpuPanel. TDD: inject one
  cluster of 70% cores → the grid must emit a warn-tier `▆` (`38;2;219;188;127`), which the old
  cpu-green row never did; red→green (collision-free — `▆` comes only from the grid/sparklines, and
  only the grid runs `levelColor`). `MIN_CHECKS` 62→63. `pnpm verify` PASS (63). **Follow-up:** the
  CpuPanel P/E *average* bars still render both rows on a single cluster — minor; host is Apple Silicon.

- **RD4 (part 2) — `BigNumber` hero number (branch `redesign`).** Added `src/lib/bignum.ts` (3×5
  block-figure font, 0–9 + `-`/space; `bigDigits()` joins glyphs with a 1-col gap → 5 rows) and
  `BigNumber.vue` (renders the rounded value as 5-row figures with a gentle same-hue top-bright ramp,
  solid below truecolor via the SAME D11 gate as the meters/graph, so the whole panel decides
  truecolor↔256 identically). Wired into the CPU hero, replacing the small `42%` text — the panel now
  leads with a big block number over the braille history graph (Principle 1 "one hero metric, BIG").
  TDD: verify injects `cpu.usage=88` → the two big 8s emit `█ █ █ █` (a signature no bar/braille/
  sparkline produces); red (absent) → green. `MIN_CHECKS` 61→62. `pnpm verify` PASS (62). Also removed
  the RD3-era throwaway `cool-proto.mjs` (its palette-picking job is done).
  **To eyeball:** `FORCE_COLOR=3 node dist/machud.mjs` — the CPU hero-number gradient. **Note:** tier-1
  is now lopsided (tall CPU vs short MEM) until MEM earns its hero/density — expected mid-RD4; next
  parts: per-core grid, MEM/GPU/DISK density, then the 3-tier layout + stability.

- **RD0d — real `npx` artifact gate: pack → install → exec (branch `redesign`).** verify §6 only
  inspected the local checkout, so a packaging bug that bites only the *installed* package could sail
  through green. Added verify §9: `pnpm pack` (publishes the pnpm way — resolves `catalog:`, runs
  `prepack`) on a **clean tree** (rm the bundle first) → `npm install <tgz>` into a throwaway project
  (the `npx`/consumer side) → exec the **installed** `.bin/machud --once`. Asserts the tarball carries
  `dist/machud.mjs`, the bin links, and it exits 0 + renders `CPU`. `MIN_CHECKS` 58→61.
  **TDD red:** a no-op `prepack` (→ binless tarball) turned all 3 RD0d checks RED while §6 stayed
  GREEN — proving real-artifact coverage §6 can't give (the Task-2 "clean tree packed a bin-less
  tarball" bug). Restored → **`pnpm verify` PASS (61)**.
  **Findings worth keeping:** chalk is a *transitive* dep of `@vue-tui/runtime` and npm hoists it in
  the consumer, so dropping a *direct* dep does NOT break the installed bin; and pnpm's strict
  symlinked node_modules drops a direct dep's top-level link on a deps-sync, breaking *local*
  resolution — so the binless-tarball break (not a missing-dep break) is the honest red here.
  **To eyeball / note:** the gate is now heavier (a second full build via prepack + a real `npm
  install`) and needs network on a cold npm cache — expected per the backlog's "heavier/slower",
  kept as the last functional section. Only `scripts/verify.mjs` changed (package.json restored).

- **RD4 (part 1) — braille area history graph (branch `redesign`).** New `brailleArea()`
  (2×4-subpixel area chart) + `Graph.vue` (measures its own width, vertical gradient top→bottom,
  truecolor-aware via D11). Swapped the CPU panel's 1-row Sparkline for a **tall 4-row braille graph**
  — the flowing btop-style history (the start of making the CPU hero dense, not boring, per the owner
  feedback). The `--once`/verify path has no rolling history, so App now synthesizes a **flat band at
  the current reading** (honest — no invented trend; the live app uses the real history). verify
  asserts a braille area graph renders. `pnpm verify` PASS (58). Next RD4: per-core grid, BigNumber,
  MEM/GPU graphs, then the 3-tier layout + stability + hue confinement.

- **Two-tone `mac|hud` wordmark (owner request; branch `redesign`).** The top-left logo now splits
  the word: **`mac`** in Apple aluminium/silver (`#c4c9cf` dark / `#8d939a` light) and **`hud`** in
  the brand green — highlighting the "HUD for the Mac" reading. Added a `silver` token to the palette
  (theme.ts + DESIGN.md, owner-directed extension of D9); the key-by-key theme pin now covers 18
  tokens per mode. `pnpm verify` PASS (57).

- **RD3 review fix — D11 gradient gate now matches the renderer (branch `redesign`).** The RD3
  visual review (verdict fix) caught a real major: `supportsTruecolor()` keyed off `COLORTERM`, but
  vue-tui emits 24-bit via **chalk's level** — so on kitty/wezterm/ghostty/iTerm/SSH (TERM-truecolor,
  no COLORTERM) the gradient was silently lost, and on `COLORTERM=24bit` + 256-colour TERM it banded.
  Fixed: added `chalk` as a direct dep and `supportsTruecolor() = chalk.level >= 3` — byte-for-byte
  the same signal as the renderer, so they can't diverge. Verified end-to-end: `chalk.level 3` →
  per-cell gradient (13 colours in one bar), `chalk.level 2` → solid, no 38;2 (no banding).
  Strengthened the verify gradient assertion to **per-bar** (whole-frame chrome alone passed the old
  `>8` threshold). Also hardened `barCells`/`hexToRgb` against NaN/malformed input (latent, one line
  each). `pnpm verify` PASS (57).

- **Dropped accessibility — owner ruling, VOUCHED (branch `redesign`).** Owner ruled a11y out of
  scope (D14): for a passive full-screen TUI the only realistic a11y is colour-independence, and even
  that isn't wanted. Reverted the `○◐●` status glyphs (RD3 pt1) — status is colour-only again
  (MemoryPanel, SensorsPanel, format.ts). **GATE WEAKENED:** removed the verify "● on High pressure"
  assertion and lowered `MIN_CHECKS` 58→57 — a *sanctioned* removal per the owner ruling (autonomy
  gate-rule 2). Scrubbed a11y from DESIGN.md (Principle 2, glyph token, Sensors mapping, Do's/Don'ts)
  and added **D14 [VOUCHED]**. The braille area *graph* (RD4) is KEPT — it's a drawing technique, not
  a11y (owner confirmed after we untangled the term). The `⇡/⇣` charge glyph + `—` stay (real info,
  not a11y). `pnpm verify` PASS (57).

- **RD3 (part 3) — gradient meters + D11 colour-tier fallback (branch `redesign`).** New
  `src/lib/color.ts` (hex mix / same-hue `ramp` / `supportsTruecolor`). Bar.vue now renders each
  filled cell as a **same-hue dim→accent gradient** on truecolor terminals, and degrades to the
  **solid accent** below truecolor (D11). Key finding: vue-tui decides 24-bit emission from
  `COLORTERM`, NOT the `FORCE_COLOR` level, so `supportsTruecolor()` keys off `COLORTERM` (matching
  what the renderer actually emits). verify asserts the truecolor frame has many distinct 38;2
  colours (gradient) and a 256-colour frame (COLORTERM unset) has none (clean degrade). `pnpm verify`
  PASS (58). Remaining RD3: braille area Graph.

- **RD3 (part 2) — disk earned near-full signal (branch `redesign`).** DiskPanel was hardcoded to
  the disk hue with no escalation. Now it stays calm (module hue) until near-full, then an EARNED
  signal escalates on both colour AND text: amber `NEAR FULL` ≥85%, red `FULL` ≥95% (the bar colour
  + the right-hand label both flip). verify injects 96% (RD0c hook) and asserts `FULL` renders.
  `pnpm verify` PASS (56). Remaining RD3: gradient Meter, braille Graph, D11 fallback.

- **RD3 (part 1) — status glyphs + ⚡→⇡ (branch `redesign`).** Added a `statusGlyph()` helper
  (`○` calm / `◐` elevated / `● ` alert) and wired it into MemoryPanel (pressure) and SensorsPanel
  (thermal), so status now rides a **non-hue channel** (color-blind safe, DESIGN.md Principle 2) —
  not colour alone. Replaced the last two `⚡` (BatteryPanel + HeaderBar) with `⇡`. verify now asserts
  **no `⚡` anywhere in the frame** and **`●` renders on High** pressure (injected via the RD0c hook).
  `pnpm verify` PASS (55). Remaining RD3: gradient Meter, braille Graph, BigNumber, DiskPanel
  near-full ramp, D11 colour-tier fallback.

- **RD2 review fixes (branch `redesign`).** The data-honesty review (verdict fix) found the data
  layer solid but two visible product defects: (1) the charging detector matched "disCHARGING"
  (`/charging/i` with no word boundary), so the panel showed "⚡ charging" while discharging —
  contradicting RD2's new negative `chargeWatts`; fixed to `/\bcharging\b/` + exclude discharging,
  and added a verify coherence assertion (never `charging` while `chargeWatts<0`). (2) The new watts
  were collected but never rendered; BatteryPanel now shows `power −5.9W` / `+24W · 96W adapter`.
  Also hardened two provenance tests: chargeWatts now `present`-guarded (won't false-RED on a
  battery-less Mac), and memory pressure pairs `1→Normal` with `4→High` so it can't false-pass on a
  loaded host. `pnpm verify` PASS (53). Confirmed live: panel shows "discharging" + "power −5.9W".

- **RD2 — data-honesty collectors (branch `redesign`).** Made the headline metrics true, each TDD
  (red provenance assertion → implement → green) with a collector-level test hook: **memory** reads
  the real `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` (1/2/4→Normal/Elevated/High), heuristic only as a
  fallback (`MACHUD_TEST_PRESSURE_LEVEL`); **battery** adds `adapterWatts` (AdapterDetails.Watts) +
  `chargeWatts` = V·A/1e6 with a signed-64 reinterpret of ioreg's UNSIGNED Amperage
  (`MACHUD_TEST_AMPERAGE`; live-verified -6.16 W on battery); **cpu** models one cluster on Intel
  instead of `0P+0E` (`MACHUD_TEST_NO_PERFLEVEL`); **network** drops the LAN IP (D12 — type/empty/
  collector/panel; interface name stays in the header). `pnpm verify` PASS (51 assertions).

- **RD0c — synthetic-input injection mechanism (branch `redesign`).** `collectAll()` now applies
  `MACHUD_TEST_OVERRIDE` — a JSON env deep-merged into the snapshot (sibling of
  `MACHUD_TEST_APPEARANCE`; product path untouched when unset) — so the gate can exercise states this
  host can't produce. TDD: added the verify assertion (inject `memory.pressure="High"` → red while
  unbuilt), implemented the deep-merge → green. `pnpm verify` PASS (45). RD2 will use this for the
  battery-sign / pressure-level / Intel / near-full-disk fixtures.

- **RD1 — Everforest palette landed (first visual change; branch `redesign`).** Rewrote
  `src/theme.ts` from Tokyo Night to the **Everforest** tokens (dark + light) from DESIGN.md, adding
  `bgLift` + `accent` (the brand green). verify.mjs now **pins** the dark tokens — `#2d353b` and
  `#a7c080` must appear in BOTH DESIGN.md and theme.ts — and asserts no Tokyo-Night leftovers, so the
  palette can't silently desync from the spec (autonomy rule 5). `pnpm verify` PASS (44 assertions).
  **To eyeball the green:** `node dist/machud.mjs` live, or `FORCE_COLOR=3 node dist/machud.mjs
  --once` (confirmed `--once` emits truecolor under FORCE_COLOR — useful for RD3's color-fidelity
  tests). Layout/glyphs unchanged — this is colour only; the 3-tier layout is RD4.

- **RD0b — visual-correctness harness (branch `redesign`).** Added strip-ANSI + widest-line
  measurement to verify.mjs and the assertion that holds on current code: **no overflow at the wide
  target (widest line ≤ 120)** — the wide layout fits exactly at 120 today, so this guards any future
  change from overflowing it. Reframed the backlog: the other visual assertions (no-`⚡`, FORCE_COLOR
  fallback, bar alignment, narrow-width no-overflow) are TDD-coupled to RD3/RD4/RD5 and land WITH
  those features — a monolithic "all visual assertions first" was infeasible (can't assert "no `⚡`"
  before it's removed). `pnpm verify` PASS (41 assertions; floor pinned to 41).

- **RD0 — hardened the verify gate (safety net; branch `redesign`).** Closed the three confirmed
  holes the adversarial reviews found: (a) `inRange` accepted `null` (a metric silently degrading to
  `—` passed every range check) — split into a strict `inRange` (null/NaN → red, for present-required
  metrics) and `inRangeOrNull` (GPU util / battery health stay honestly nullable); proved
  `inRange(null)=false` now vs the old `true`. (b) The build check passed on a stale bundle even when
  the build failed — now `rm`s `dist/machud.mjs` before building, so a failed build leaves it absent →
  red. (c) Added an assertion-count pin (`MIN_CHECKS=40`) so deleting/loosening a check turns the gate
  red, making autonomy.md's strengthen-only rule machine-enforced. `pnpm verify` PASS (40 assertions;
  the pin reads the pre-increment count). Also made the gate Intel-tolerant (no-P/E-split) and a build
  failure now exits with one clean red instead of a cascade.
  Filed **RD0d** for the heavier real-`npx` pack→install→exec gate (from the Task-2 review).

- **Task 2 — `npx machud` runnable (D13; branch `redesign`).** Made the package publishable and the
  bin executable: removed `private: true`, added `files`/`engines`/`keywords`/`prepublishOnly`, moved
  dev-only `@vue-tui/cli` to devDependencies (the bundle only imports `@vue-tui/runtime` + `vue`), and
  added a rollup `output.banner` shebang so `dist/machud.mjs` runs as a bin (Node strips it from
  `.mjs`, so `node dist/machud.mjs` is unaffected). New verify.mjs **packaging** section asserts the
  built bin starts with `#!/usr/bin/env node`, the package is not private, and `bin.machud` resolves —
  TDD red (2 fails) → green. `pnpm verify` **PASS**. (Publishing itself is an outward action — not
  done; the package is just *ready* to `npx`.)
  **Task-2 adversarial review caught a BLOCKER** (verdict blocking): `engines.node` was `>=20`, but
  `@vue-tui/runtime@0.1.0` requires `>=22.18.0` (it pulls `string-width@8`, whose top-level `/v`
  RegExp throws SyntaxError below Node 22.18) — so `npx machud` would crash at load on Node 20. Fixed:
  `engines.node >=22.18.0` + a verify assertion that our floor ≥ the installed runtime's floor (drift
  guard); added `prepack: vp build` (`npm pack` doesn't run `prepublishOnly`, and dist is gitignored,
  so a clean tree packed a bin-less tarball); narrowed `files` to drop a stray `dist/icons.svg`.
  Confirmed `npm pack --dry-run` → 3 clean files. `pnpm verify` PASS.

- **QA review applied + D9/D13 vouched (docs only; branch `redesign`).** Ran a consolidation-QA
  adversarial review (4 auditors + a Codex pass) over the redesign docs; it returned `fix-then-lock`
  and caught a BLOCKING miss + 2 factual errors I'd carried in. Fixed all on branch `redesign`:
  (BLOCKING) `autonomous-development-plan.md` still hardcoded the old B2→B3→B4 order — replaced with
  a pointer to backlog.md; `architecture.md` Layers/source-table now tagged SHIPPED-vs-TARGET (3-row
  grid + IP); corrected the **`useWindowSize` "constant 80"** claim in 4 files (it's reactive; the
  real seam is the gate's `COLUMNS`→`renderToString` width); corrected the **battery sign** spec —
  ioreg `Amperage` is an unsigned 64-bit int, reinterpret before the `<0` test; made RD2 acceptance
  provenance-distinguishing, broke RD0c's circular dependency, and added a gate-strength count-pin to
  RD0. **Vouched D9 (Everforest visual identity) and D13 (`npx machud` zero-install distribution)**
  with `[VOUCHED @hyf0]`, added both to the autonomy stop-list. **`pnpm verify` PASS (unchanged —
  docs only).** Next: re-run adversarial review on this fix, then RD0.

- **Design session — visual identity + redesign plan (docs only; no code change yet).**
  Settled machud's look as "**cool but refined**" (drama from FORM, calm from COLOR), palette
  **Everforest** green-forward, and wrote it up as [`/DESIGN.md`](../../DESIGN.md) — the hands-off
  aesthetic anchor (D9). Decisions this round: **sudo dropped entirely** (D2 strengthened, B5
  DROPPED — "never asks for your password" is now identity); **opinionated contribution policy**
  ([`/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md), D10); **3-tier layout** (tier-1 CPU+Memory; tier-2
  Network/GPU/Battery; tier-3 status strip) with **responsive reopened** (D4 — owner reopened,
  scoped to 2-tier, built last); **truecolor color-tier fallback** (D11); **no-IP waiver** (D12).
  Per-module spec set: real memory-pressure sysctl, live battery adapter/charge watts, per-core
  P/E (Apple-Silicon-only), network human units + no IP, status carried on `○/◐/●` glyphs
  (color-blind safe).
  Ran TWO adversarial multi-agent reviews. The second one found the conclusions were **not safe to
  lock as-is** — DESIGN.md claimed `theme.ts` mirrored Everforest (it's still Tokyo Night), still
  encoded "fixed 3-row / no responsive," and the redesign was never in the backlog; plus three
  live verify holes (`inRange(null)→true`, build-passes-on-stale-bundle, no strengthen-only). Acted
  on all of it: reconciled DESIGN.md (marked TARGET vs shipped, fixed the contradictions), and
  **restaged the backlog RD0–RD5 safety-net-first** so the loop hardens `verify.mjs` BEFORE any
  visual rewrite. Added gate-integrity rules to autonomy.md (strengthen-only, responsive must be
  render-tested, TARGET≠shipped).
  **No `src/` changed; `pnpm verify` NOT re-run (nothing to verify yet).** A throwaway truecolor
  prototype `cool-proto.mjs` was added to choose the palette (delete after RD3). **To eyeball:**
  `node cool-proto.mjs` (Everforest dark = flavor 4, light = flavor 7).

- **Autonomous development plan added.** Added
  `autonomous-development-plan.md` as the owner/agent handoff file: what the owner
  needs to decide, the agent operating loop, stop conditions, current execution
  order, and non-blocking decisions worth tightening later. Linked it from
  `AGENTS.md`. **Verify: PASS (38 assertions).**

- **TDD-first autonomy rule.** Captured the owner's process preference that
  autonomous work should follow TDD: add or extend failing verification first,
  implement the smallest passing change, then refactor. Because `vp test` is
  upstream-broken, `pnpm verify` / `scripts/verify.mjs` is the primary harness for
  now. Updated `AGENTS.md` and autonomy charter. **Verify: PASS (38 assertions).**

- **System-following light/dark appearance.** Resolved the dark-mode/D1 ambiguity:
  machud now supports both light and dark palettes, selected automatically from
  macOS system appearance (`defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle`) with no
  user-facing switch/config. Added `appearance` to the metrics snapshot, made the
  theme reactive, added an internal verify-only override for both palettes, and
  fixed the Sensors thermal color to update reactively. Updated architecture,
  decisions, backlog, and open questions. **Verify: PASS (38 assertions).** To
  eyeball: light palette contrast in a real light terminal.

- **Autonomy framework set up.** Added the machine-checked gate `pnpm verify`
  (`scripts/verify.mjs`, pure node — independent of the broken `vp test`): builds,
  asserts `--json` value ranges, asserts every panel renders in `--once`, and
  drives a PTY to confirm the D7 alternate-screen takeover. Added a `--json`
  snapshot mode to `main.ts`. Wrote charter (autonomy.md), backlog.md,
  open-questions.md. **Verify: PASS (29 assertions).** To eyeball: nothing visual
  changed this milestone.

- **Initial build.** machud first complete version — 7 panels (CPU P/E, Memory,
  GPU, Disk, Network, Battery, Sensors) on a wide-screen dashboard, zero-sudo
  collectors, alternate-screen takeover. **Verify: PASS.**
